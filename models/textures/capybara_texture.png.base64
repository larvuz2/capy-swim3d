This is a placeholder for the capybara texture.

Since we can't upload binary files directly through the API, you'll need to create a simple texture file named 'capybara_texture.png' in this directory.

The texture should be a simple brown color with some details for the capybara's face and body.

Alternatively, the code has been updated to handle missing textures gracefully by applying a default brown material.
