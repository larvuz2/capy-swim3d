# Texture Files

This directory contains texture files for the 3D models.

## Important Note About Textures

The code is configured to look for a texture file named `capybara_texture.png` in this directory. 

Since you mentioned you have this file locally, please make sure it's placed in this directory for the model to display correctly.

## Texture Format

The texture should be a standard PNG file with dimensions that are powers of 2 (e.g., 512x512, 1024x1024, etc.) for optimal performance.

## Default Behavior

If the texture file is not found, the code will automatically apply a default brown material to the capybara model.
