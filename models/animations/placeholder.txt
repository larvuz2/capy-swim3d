Place your animation files in this directory:

- capybara_idle.fbx - Idle animation
- capybara_walk.fbx - Walk animation (optional)
- capybara_run.fbx - Run animation (optional)
- capybara_jump.fbx - Jump animation (optional)

The code will automatically look for the idle animation file here if it's not included in the main model.
